# Daily Owl 🦉

**Your wise daily digest by Anacleto**

A dynamically generated daily news digest that changes completely every day - content, design, and style.

## What's This?

Every morning at 6:00 AM, Anacleto (the AI owl) wakes up, reads the internet, and creates a fresh daily digest page with:
